1. **Summary of my Activities and Future Plans**

[_the bibliography references appearing in this research statement refer to the journal articles appearing in this file_]

I have being working at SCE right after my postdoctoral studies in the Hebrew University, in the department of Electrical Engineering of the Ashdod Campus. I hold the position of Lecturer from 2009 to 2012, and was appointed to senior lecturer from 2012. I also am an adjunct lecturer at Afeka College of Engineering since 2017, at Ben-Gurion University since 2018 and at Tel-Aviv University since 2020. I have been serving in several administrative duties in the department of Electrical Engineering of SCE, and am currently the coordinator of the final-year projects at B.Sc level (since 2010), and a member of the teaching committee and the curriculum committee. I have been an invited researcher in 2013 at the Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique (French equivalent of the Kamag), France, and an invited lecturer in 2018 at the Polytechnic University of Madrid (UPM), Spain. During my collaboration with Prof. Luengo from Madrid university I got involved in an ERASMUS+ Capacity project which led to the development of new curricula and courses in three departments at SCE, along with publications. I was the national coordinator of this project in Israel, during which I worked closely with researchers from Holon Institute of Technology and Bar Ilan University, and overall with more than twenty researchers of different institutions in Spain, Austria, Belgium, and Ukraine.

My research focuses mainly on statistical signal processing and applications of compressive sensing and machine learning tools, specifically for signals stemming from point processes sample paths (Shot-Noise model and its derivatives). Applications in which such signals are encountered are numerous, and my two main areas of investigation are in nuclear spectroscopy and biomedical signals.

Development of new methods for nuclear spectroscopy signals: nuclear spectroscopy signals appear frequently in security applications, decommissioning and medical imaging. For all these applications, it is of critical interest to estimate precisely the activity of radioactive sources, and to identify them, and the signal is often modeled by a filtered Poisson process. During my post-doctoral stay at the Hebrew University, I developed a time-domain model to consider gamma spectroscopic signals as a sparse regression problem, and developed an algorithm based on a thresholded version of LASSO to estimate precisely the activity of a radioactive source, even at very high counting rates. The main difficulty was to illustrate mathematically how such an approach could hold, as it is well known from compressive sensing theory that sparse reconstruction is possible only when drastic conditions on the dictionary used hold. We showed in [15] that under mild conditions, relating the intensity and the sampling frequency of the device, the activity could be estimated precisely even if standard conditions on the dictionary did not hold in practice in the case of a homogeneous Poisson process. We implemented various estimate with different sparse methods, and later on extended the previous result in the non-homogeneous setting [11], by plugging the estimated arrival times into a nonparametric estimation of the activity. Furthermore, we showed in [12] that this methodology could be beneficial for pile-up correction in this framework, and provided empirical proofs that the obtained energy spectra were less distorted once the iterative reconstruction had been applied (an application example can also be found in [3]). The last remaining obstacle was the computational time, since the signals recorded in the field are usually very large. Thus, I developed in [4,9] a fast algorithm for solving the related optimization procedures on very larges signals (more than several millions points), based on the use of Fast Fourier Transforms in proximal methods, which allows now to process large dataset in a very short time, without any other memory use than the one necessary to load the signal itself. The method proposed in [4] has also the advantage to be faster by about two decades than the standard optimization programming, and can be applied for a wide class of sparse optimization problems which satisfy an homogeneity condition.

Statistical signal processing for biomedical signals: In my ongoing collaboration with Prof. Luengo, we developed algorithms to investigate atrial fibrillation in intracardiac ECG, recorded during operation procedures. The recorded signals in this topic are different mainly in two points: contrary to spectroscopic signals, they do not overlap due to physiological constraints. Second, they are recorded using a multi-electrode catheter, which results in a multichannel signal where all pulses are roughly synchronized. Electrode motion noise also makes some peaks less obvious in the recordings, and an additional difficulty is the lack of data making the use of deep learning methods irrelevant. Based on these considerations, we developed a novel algorithm based on a version of the grouped LASSO with overlapping groups, and investigated its properties in [2]. The proposed algorithm was shown to locate the peaks in intracardiac ECG recordings very efficiently; furthermore, we showed that it could be implemented efficiently using an acceleration of the ADMM also presented in [2]. This algorithm could therefore be implemented in medical devices used for monitoring the heart activity during invasive procedures.

Besides these two main research directions, I also collaborate with colleagues from SCE on the development of signal processing algorithms for inference, whether for nuclear physics experiments [1] or Raman spectroscopy [3].

Future research directions: I intend to pursue my research in these topics, and also to investigate the use of machine learning / signal processing tools on agriculture-related problems, as detailed below:

Regarding the use of compressive sensing and ML techniques in nuclear spectroscopy, it is clear that a lot remains to be done. Indeed, recent findings in the field show that even if time-domain approaches improve significantly the state of the art, they are less performant at very high counting rate. A change of paradigm is therefore necessary. A couple of years ago I started collaborating with Prof. Jonathan Manton from the university of Melbourne on the matter. The main objective in the long-run is to develop new mathematical tools to either improve the existing algorithm, or to better assess their performances. I also started in 2022 to collaborate on with Prof. Xiaoying Zheng from the Shanghai Advanced Research Institute, to introduce Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in Nuclear Instrumentation Devices with GPUs for pile-up correction. Though the data acquisition in this field is very challenging, this lead can yield promising results.

In the field of biological signals, I intend to continue my ongoing collaboration with Prof. Luengo to develop statistical signal processing tools to better take into consideration the physiological constraints into the sparsity penalties commonly used. In the next step, I will work on the automatic AF identification based on auxiliary recordings (speech, breathing, etc.) at early stages

Due to an ongoing collaboration between SCE and the faculty of Agriculture of the Hebrew University, I started collaborating with Dr. Ittai Hermann on the automatic assessment of metabolites of leaves and spices, based on hyperspectral and standard imaging. My aim is to see how the previously developed methods could help to obtain precise results for industrial production.
