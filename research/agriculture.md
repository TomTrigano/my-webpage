Due to an ongoing collaboration between SCE and the faculty of Agriculture of the Hebrew University, I started collaborating with Dr. Ittai Hermann on the automatic assessment of metabolites of leaves and spices, based on hyperspectral and standard imaging. My aim is to see how the previously developed methods could help to obtain precise results for industrial production.
