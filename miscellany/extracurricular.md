## What I do not like

I'm way over 40, so the list is long. In a nutshell, I do not like things that prevent people's critical thinking. This includes (but is not limited to) politicians, social networks, cult leaders, marketing, pseudo-science and possibly ananas on pizza. But I have no factual proof for the possible correlation between the lack of critical thinking and ananas on pizza.
