Welcome to Tom Trigano's homepage!

I'm a Senior Lecturer at SCE (Shamoon College of Engineering - Ashdod campus) in the department of Electrical Engineering since 2009.

I love playing with signals and images, and have been doing so for quite some time. During the past twenty years, I have been in contact with signals from Gamma spectrometers (I'm no physicist, so my knowledge in nuclear science remained shaky), electrocardiograms (I'm no doctor, so my knowledge in medicine remained shaky), feet images (I'm not an orthopedist, so...), plant pictures (I'm no agro-engineer, so...) and some other. But in most cases, as long as I can develop an algorithm to process it, I'm a happy person (and if I can also find some theoretical bounds for it, I'm even happier).

Before that, I've been a post-doctoral fellow in the department of Statistics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (Israel), and long before that a student and PhD candidate at Telecom ParisTech in Paris, France.

You'll find in this homepage relevant information about the courses I'm teaching, the research I'm doing, and at a more general level research topics that I find interesting or found interesting at some points. If one of these aspects interests you, feel free to contact me. I'll bring the coffee.
