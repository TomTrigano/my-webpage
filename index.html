<p>Hello there, and welcome to my homepage!<br><br>My name is Tom Trigano, and I am a senior lecturer at SCE, Ashdod campus.

I maintain a list of my publications under the <a href="/research/">Research</a> tab, and a list of my research interests under the <a href="/research">research</a> tab. You may also check out my Github profile (link below).<br><br>

To get a better insight on my life so far, you can have a look at my <a href="/cv">curriculum vitae</a>. I write announcements and thoughts (although quite less frequently) and pin them down <a href="/blog">here</a>. Feel free to read a bit more <a href="/about">about me</a>.</p>
