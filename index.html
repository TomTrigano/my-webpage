<p>Hello there, and welcome to my homepage!<br><br>My name is Tom Trigano, and I am a senior lecturer at SCE, Ashdod campus.

I maintain a list of my publications under the Publications tab, and a list of my research interests under the Research tab. You may also check out my Github profile (link below).<br><br>

To get a better insight on my life so far, you can have a look at my resume. I write announcements and thoughts (although quite less frequently) and pin them down. Feel free to read.</p>
